# Medieval Irish Narrative Visualised

The [graph](http://ancatmara.github.io/ulster-project/) shows the co-occurrence of characters in the Ulster cycle. Every node corresponds to a character: the bigger it is, the more connetions the character has. Characters are connected with a link if they occur together in a window of size 5. The thickness of the link indicates how often these characters co-occur. Colours show the degree of each node.
